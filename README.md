## Description

This project is a web application that mimics a simplified Pokedex from the popular cartoon series Pokémon. Using a minimalist design it allows the user to go through the Pokémon in the PokéAPI by simply entering the ID number of the Pokémon or the name of the Pokémon(if they know which one they're after).

## Features

### How to use the webpage

Similarly if you're a Pokémon fan or know some of the Pokémon names, type in the Pokémon name and hit enter or tap the search button to reveal the Pokémon name and image.

### Users of the application will be able to:

* View the name of the Pokémon searched
* View the image of the Pokémon searched
